                    completely single is exponentially increasing each year. But why is it happening? Why is everyone so obsessed with being alone?
                    
                    <h4>Let's find out.</h4> 

                    <h2 class="highlighted" >Everyone loves their careers!</h2>
                    <span class="text-line-spacing">
                        First and foremost, many people are focused on their careers and personal goals and don’t have the time or energy to devote to a serious relationship.
                        I always find this little concerning. No matter what happens in my life, my family, friends, and the person who has my heart will always be more important than some career that can and will always be replaced. The average tenure for someone in a company is two years or less! As a person who’s worked in the corporate world for 12 years, let me be clear. They’d drop you at the smallest whim if they had to. They don’t give a shit about you or your personal life. If you believe they do, then you, my friend, are living in a very idealist, naive world.

                        Despite this, people still focus on their careers more than human connections. Irrespective of friends and family. It’s genuinely scary how society has warped what worldly desires actually matter. In the end, when you die, your family, friends, and maybe someone you love will be at your funeral. Not “Amazon LLC.”

                                Weird.

                        With the rise of the gig economy and the increasing pressure to succeed professionally, it’s not surprising that many people are choosing to prioritize their careers over their love lives. I’m not saying you should quit your big wig corporate 6 figure job and start chasing people at a whim. But there are worlds we live in where you have both. Things don’t always have to be so myopic. I actively dated whilst still maintaining a healthy career; it’s possible. It really doesn’t have to be one of the other.
                        In addition to this, there’s a growing trend towards individualism and self-fulfillment. So many people believe they are the center of the universe and “the main character.” So much so they’re unbearable to be around; this may be making it more difficult for people to connect with others on a deeper level. With the rise of social media and the emphasis on personal branding, many people are more focused on themselves than on building lasting relationships with others.

                        Human connections are more important than the latest video game, blog post, podcast, money, and all the rest.
                                            
                        When did we get so lost in our own ego-centric paradigm?
                                            

                    </span>
                    <h2 class="highlighted">We know too much shit!</h2>
                    <span class="text-line-spacing">
                        We are over-informed with knowledge and data. The plethora of information available on relationships and dating may be changing the way we approach finding a partner, causing us to focus more on what to look out for than what to look for. That’s why I try my best to be objective and other another view rather than prescribe people to listen to what I have to say as gospel.

                        In the age of the internet and social media, we are constantly bombarded with information about relationships and dating. While this can be helpful in many ways, it can also be overwhelming and lead to an excessive focus on the negative aspects of dating and relationships.
                                            
                        A study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Review found that people who had access to a greater amount of information about their potential romantic partners tended to be more critical of them and less satisfied with their relationships overall (Finkel et al., 2012). This suggests that too much information can actually hinder our ability to form healthy, fulfilling relationships. That’s why I don’t add people to my social media until I’ve at least met them in public a few times. I have nothing to hide, but I’m also not gonna just share my whole ass life with a stranger.
                                            
                        Furthermore, the abundance of dating apps and websites has led to a commodification of potential partners, with people treated as interchangeable products rather than unique individuals. This can lead to a focus on superficial traits rather than deeper compatibility and connection.
                                            
                        I think you must approach dating and relationships with a balance of knowledge and intuition. While it’s important to be informed and aware of red flags or warning signs, it’s equally important to focus on the positive qualities and shared values that make a relationship fulfilling and sustainable.
                                            
                        As the philosopher Alan Watts once said, “The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.” In other words, rather than focusing too much on what to look out for, we should embrace the uncertainty and unpredictability of dating and relationships and be open to new experiences and opportunities for connection.

                    <h2 class="highlighted">So what can YOU do?</h2>
                    
                    While there may be many factors contributing to the rise of singledom, there are also plenty of ways to overcome these challenges and find meaningful connections with others. Here are a few tips to help you navigate the complexities of modern dating and find the love you’ve been looking for:

                    Focus on building genuine connections with others, rather than just pursuing physical attraction or surface-level qualities. Just hold your horses before you try and get it in.
                    Take time to reflect on your own values and what you’re looking for in a partner, and be willing to compromise and make adjustments when necessary.
                    Get involved in activities and hobbies that align with your interests and values, and that allow you to meet new people in a low-pressure environment.
                    Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable and authentic with others, even if it means risking rejection or disappointment. Only the strong in mind can handle rejection. That’s you!
                    Finally, remember that finding love is a journey, not a destination. It takes time, effort, and a willingness to learn and grow along the way.
                    The beauty will always lie the attempt and what it took to get there!
                    In conclusion, the rise of singledom is a complex phenomenon that has many contributing factors. However, with a little bit of effort and a willingness to be vulnerable and authentic, it’s still possible to find meaningful connections with others in today’s fast-paced, modern world. So go out there, be yourself, and take a chance on love — you never know what amazing things could be waiting for you!
